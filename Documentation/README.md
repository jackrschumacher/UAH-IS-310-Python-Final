# IS 310 Python final Project   

## Ideas

### Fake news detector
  * Libraries planning on using:
    * spaCy
    * scikit-learn
#### spaCy install instructions
* Make sure to use a .env so you dont make any system changes when working with the project
* The `import spacy` statement will not be recognized by intellisense, but it will work if it is installed correctly, otherwise will throw an error
* [Install spaCy here](https://spacy.io/usage)
